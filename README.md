## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my learning journey as a junior backend developer exploring MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks and routing systems. This space serves as both a personal learning log and a resource for others who are also getting started with backend architecture and design patterns.

My current focus is on understanding how modern MVC frameworks structure applications, handle routing, and manage data flow between the server and the client. From defining clean and organized routes to connecting controllers with models and views, Iâ€™m learning how these pieces come together to build scalable and maintainable web applications.

This repository includes small projects, experiments, and boilerplates built with various backend frameworks like Express (Node.js), Laravel (PHP), Django (Python), and others. Each project is an attempt to deepen my understanding of routing logic, middleware usage, RESTful API design, and templating engines. I aim to write clean, well-commented code and include explanations of how and why certain decisions were made.

Beyond just getting things to work, Iâ€™m interested in learning the "why" behind best practicesâ€”how to structure a project for long-term maintainability, how to write reusable code, and how to debug and test routes effectively. This repository reflects that process: not just polished code, but learning moments and progress over time.

If you're also learning backend development or want to revisit the fundamentals of MVC and routing, I hope this content is helpful. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, collaboration, and suggestionsâ€”especially from more experienced developers willing to share their perspective.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to explore, fork, or contribute as I continue growing my skills in backend development.
